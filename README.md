# Phémios

Phémios is the local-first desktop client for Aède, built with SolidJS, TypeScript and Tauri 2. It presents Aède's graph and capabilities without duplicating the engine or changing source music files.

## Start

Use Node.js 22.12+ within major 22, major 24 or 26+, and Rust 1.90+, plus the [Tauri platform prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). The resolved Tauri crates declare Rust 1.90; builds here were verified with Rust 1.99. Execution on the minimum toolchain is still pending.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run tauri dev
```

`npm run dev` serves a browser-only offline preview at `http://127.0.0.1:1420`. `npm run tauri dev` starts the native window with its typed bridge. No server connection or audio playback starts automatically.

The first interface uses a fictional bundled catalog: artists → artist page → album page, optional artist banner/background, draggable year/alphabet intervals, icon sorting, cover-preserving density modes and hideable navigation. Country/genre lists work in the demonstration. Album annotations and transfer options are temporary UI drafts; no server data or music files are written. The globe, relationship graph, persistent cache, playback, collections, M3U and real transfer/analysis services are next phases.

## Verify and build

```sh
npm run format
npm run check
npm run build:native
```

`tools/check.sh` is authoritative and runs formatting, correctness lint, behavior tests, frontend type checking/build, Tauri bridge-version validation, Rust formatting/tests/Clippy/Rustdoc and native executable compilation. Native bundling is separate. `npm run build:native` builds the host platform's app bundle. The checked-in configuration enables no arbitrary shell, HTTP or filesystem plugin. Windows distribution will require an explicit offline-WebView2 packaging decision.

## Project map

- `src/`: SolidJS views, pure filtering/presentation policies and centralized native calls.
- `core/`: framework-independent Rust client policies, with no Tauri or catalog dependency.
- `src-tauri/`: native wiring, typed commands, minimum capabilities and app icons.
- `tools/check.sh`: authoritative verification gate.
- `docs/coding/current-state.md`: current implementation and verified limits.
- `docs/design/interface.md`: accepted interaction and capability contracts.
- `docs/design/roadmap.md`: coherent implementation phases.
- `docs/coding/dependencies.md`: dependency purpose, sources and compatibility evidence.

See the current-state document before claiming server, artwork, playback, physical output or device-copy support.
